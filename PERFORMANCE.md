# Performance Testing Framework

## Overview

MD Reader Pro includes an **enterprise-grade performance testing framework** designed to ensure optimal performance across all features. The framework provides automated monitoring, regression detection, detailed benchmarking capabilities, and comprehensive CI/CD integration.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Fully Operational** with 132/132 tests passing and 88.23% function coverage.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Run all performance tests
npm run test:all

# Run specific performance tests
npm run test:performance        # Core performance tests
npm run test:benchmarks        # Detailed benchmarks

# Monitor performance metrics
npm run performance:monitor     # Complete monitoring suite

# Check for performance regressions
npm run performance:regression
```

## üìä Test Suites

### 1. Performance Tests (`tests/performance.test.js`)

Core performance tests that validate performance requirements:

- **Rendering Performance**: Tests markdown parsing and rendering speed
- **Memory Performance**: Monitors memory usage and leak detection
- **File Loading Performance**: Validates file operation speeds
- **Interactive Performance**: Tests user interaction responsiveness
- **DOM Performance**: Ensures efficient DOM manipulation

**Key Metrics:**
- Small markdown: < 50ms rendering
- Medium markdown: < 200ms rendering
- Large markdown: < 1000ms rendering
- Memory usage: < 10MB increase for repeated operations
- File loading: < 150ms

### 2. Benchmark Tests (`tests/benchmarks.test.js`)

Detailed benchmarking with statistical analysis:

- **Rendering Benchmarks**: Multi-iteration performance measurements
- **Interactive Benchmarks**: User interaction timing analysis
- **File Operations Benchmarks**: File handling performance
- **Memory Usage Benchmarks**: Comprehensive memory profiling
- **Stress Tests**: High-load and concurrent operation testing

**Statistical Metrics:**
- Average execution time
- 95th and 99th percentile timings
- Memory usage patterns
- Performance consistency

## üõ† Performance Utilities

### Performance Monitor (`tests/performance-utils.js`)

```javascript
import { PerformanceMonitor } from './performance-utils.js';

const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();

// Start measurement
monitor.startMeasurement('test-name');

// Your code here

// End measurement and validate
monitor.endMeasurement('test-name');
const isValid = monitor.validatePerformance('test-name');
```

### Benchmark Runner

```javascript
import { BenchmarkRunner } from './performance-utils.js';

const runner = new BenchmarkRunner();

// Add benchmark
runner.addBenchmark('test-name', () => {
    // Code to benchmark
}, 100); // 100 iterations

// Run and get results
const result = await runner.runBenchmark('test-name');
console.log(`Average: ${result.average}ms`);
```

### Memory Profiler

```javascript
import { MemoryProfiler } from './performance-utils.js';

const profiler = new MemoryProfiler();

profiler.takeSnapshot('before');
// Code that uses memory
profiler.takeSnapshot('after');

const memoryDelta = profiler.getMemoryDelta('before', 'after');
console.log(`Memory used: ${memoryDelta.deltaUsed} bytes`);
```

## üîç Performance Regression Detection

### Automated Regression Detection

The framework includes automated regression detection that:

1. **Establishes Baselines**: Creates performance baselines for comparison
2. **Monitors Changes**: Detects performance degradations automatically
3. **Reports Issues**: Provides detailed regression analysis
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Fails builds on significant regressions

```bash
# Run regression detection
npm run performance:regression

# Update baseline after improvements
npm run performance:update-baseline
```

### Regression Thresholds

- **Rendering Time**: 20% increase triggers warning
- **Memory Usage**: 30% increase triggers warning
- **Benchmark Performance**: 25% slowdown triggers warning

### GitHub Actions Integration

Automated performance monitoring runs on:
- Every push to main branch
- All pull requests
- Daily scheduled runs

The CI pipeline:
1. Runs all performance tests
2. Compares against baselines
3. Reports regressions in PR comments
4. Blocks merges on significant performance issues

## üîß Configuration

### Jest Configuration

Performance tests use optimized Jest settings:

```javascript
// jest.config.cjs
module.exports = {
    testTimeout: 10000,
    maxWorkers: '50%',
    cache: true,
    clearMocks: true,
    restoreMocks: true
};
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable memory profiling
NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc --max-old-space-size=512"

# Disable verbose output for benchmarks
PERFORMANCE_QUIET=true
```

## üöÄ Recent Performance Optimizations

### Recent Code Efficiency Improvements

A comprehensive performance audit identified and resolved several inefficiencies in the codebase:

#### 1. Input Debouncing (300ms delay)
**Problem**: `updatePreview()` was called on every keystroke during typing, causing excessive markdown parsing and DOM updates.

**Solution**: Implemented debounced input handler that batches rapid keystrokes and only updates preview after 300ms of inactivity.

**Impact**: 
- Reduces preview updates from N calls (one per keystroke) to 1 call per 300ms pause
- Significantly lower CPU usage during typing sessions
- Smoother typing experience with no perceived lag

#### 2. DOMPurify Configuration Caching
**Problem**: Sanitization configuration object was recreated on every `updatePreview()` call.

**Solution**: Moved sanitization config to instance property, created once during construction.

**Impact**:
- Eliminates object allocation overhead on every preview update
- Reduces garbage collection pressure
- Faster preview rendering

#### 3. AnimationManager RAF Loop Optimization
**Problem**: `requestAnimationFrame` loop ran continuously at ~60 FPS even when no animations were active.

**Solution**: Implemented pause/resume mechanism that stops the RAF loop when animation queue is empty.

**Impact**:
- Reduces CPU usage from continuous 60 FPS to 0 when idle
- Battery savings on mobile/laptop devices
- Only runs when animations are actually needed

#### 4. DOM Query Caching
**Problem**: `setupHelpBar()` repeatedly queried for help icon and text elements on every document click.

**Solution**: Cache DOM element references once during setup.

**Impact**:
- Eliminates repeated `querySelector()` calls
- Faster event handler execution
- Reduced DOM traversal overhead

#### 5. File System Operation Optimization
**Problem**: Scripts used `fs.existsSync()` before `mkdirSync()` causing unnecessary I/O operations.

**Solution**: Replaced with `mkdirSync({ recursive: true })` which is idempotent and more efficient.

**Impact**:
- Reduces file system calls by 50% in affected code paths
- Faster benchmark and build script execution
- Simpler, more maintainable code

### Test Coverage
All optimizations include comprehensive test coverage:
- ‚úÖ Debouncing test verifies batched updates
- ‚úÖ 230/230 tests passing
- ‚úÖ No performance regressions detected
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
