## Common Issues

All branches share these problems:
- **Outdated**: Significantly behind current main
- **Breaking changes**: Remove important files (.github/copilot-instructions.md, BACKLOG.md, etc.)
- **Test failures**: None pass the full test suite
- **No valid fixes**: Changes are either broken or superseded by main

## Recommendation

**DELETE all 10 branches** as none contain valid fixes worth merging and all fail quality checks.
