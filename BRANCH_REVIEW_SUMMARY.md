## Common Issues Found

All branches share these problems:
1. **Outdated:** Significantly behind the current main branch
2. **Delete critical files:** All branches remove important documentation and configuration files present in main
3. **Test failures:** None of the branches pass the full test suite (main has 230 passing tests)
4. **No valid fixes:** The changes either break functionality or are superseded by main

### Action Plan

**All 10 branches should be DELETED** because:

1. None pass all quality checks (lint, build, tests)
2. All remove important files that exist in main
3. Main branch (v3.4.0) is in excellent condition and represents the latest, working state
4. The branches contain outdated attempts at fixes that either:
   - Never worked properly, or
   - Were superseded by better implementations in main

### Implementation

The following branches should be deleted from the remote repository:
- `alert-autofix-15`
- `alert-autofix-22`
- `alert-fix-21`
- `copilot/fix-6220dd61-a3c5-4439-9bfa-b206420bcda5`
- `copilot/fix-c7d7275f-8caa-4709-80d9-0eb8819cfd17`
- `copilot/fix-d1881f79-f693-40b8-9240-5ab77e2353ba`
- `copilot/fix-e96a3883-0b85-47d0-a6be-b627dee646e6`
- `copilot/fix-undeclared-variables`
- `perfomance`
- `release/3.1.0-reapply`

**Note:** Branch deletion cannot be performed directly via git commands in this environment due to force push restrictions. This summary document should be used to inform manual branch deletion via the GitHub UI or by someone with appropriate repository permissions.
